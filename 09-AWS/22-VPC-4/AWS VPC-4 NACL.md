9. Review and launch instance.

10. Note the Private IP Address of Private EC2 Instance.

11. Two servers are launched and ready.


Task 3: Testing Both EC2 instances
-----------------------------------

1.  **Public EC2 instances**: We have installed a web application on  this server.

    -   Select the **Public** EC2 instance from the instance list.

    -   From the Description tab, copy the **IPv4 Public IP**.

    -   Now paste this IP in you Web Browser

    -   You will be able to see a simple web page.
  
2.  Next, we will try to ping the Private EC2 from the Public EC2 instance.

    -   SSH into Public EC2 Instance

-   Copy the Private IP of **PrivateEC2Server** from the Description tab.

-   Ping the Private Instance using the Private IPv4

-   Example:
    ```bash
    ping 172.16.89.89
    ```

-   Press [Ctrl] + C to stop instead of pause.

-   **Note: You were able to do these tasks because the Default NACL that was created during VPC creation allows both INBOUND and  OUTBOUND by Default.**


Task 4: Modifying default NACL and Testing
----------------------------------------------

- Go to VPC service, filter myVPC and find the default NACL for myVPC
- Note that all subnets are associated with it
- Select Network ACL and click Inbound Rules
- Click Edit Inbound Rules to edit
- What you see should look like this

100	All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0	Allow
*	All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0	Deny

- Now add a line after 100 corresponding your IP to deny reach on port 80
100	All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0	Allow
101 HTTP(80) TCP 80    78.45.67.190/32 Deny
*	All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0	Deny

- Save changes
- Now check the public IP of the web instance to see if you can still reach. Can you?
- Now go to default NACL again and this time modify the rule number so that it looks like:
100	All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0	Allow
99 HTTP(80) TCP 80    78.45.67.190/32 Deny
*	All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0	Deny

- Save changes and then check the web instance again. Can you see the page?
- NACL rule numbers are put in ascending order.

Task 5: Creating Custom NACL and Associate it to the Subnet
------------------------------------------------------------

**Note:** By default, all subnets will be associated with the Default NACL of **MyVPC.** Once you create a custom NACL, attach all public and private subnets.

1.  Navigate to **VPC** under the Services menu. Click on ***Network ACL***  under **Security**

2.  Click on **Create Network ACL**

3.  Create Network ACL:

    -   Name tag: Enter ***MyPublicNACL***

    -   VPC: Select **MyVPC****from the dropdown list.

    -   Click on **Create.**

4.  Associating **MyPublicNACL** to the Public Subnet

    -   Select the Action tab and click on **Edit subnet associations**

    -   Select both the **Public and Private** subnets from the table.

    -   Click on **Save changes**

5.  Renaming the Main NACL

    -   Select the **Default NACL** of the VPC MyVPC\

    -   Enter the name ***MyPrivateNACL*** and click on **Save**

Task 6: Testing the Public and Private Server 
-----------------------------------------------

1.  Public EC2 Instance:

    -   Navigate to the **EC2 Instance Dashboard.** Click on   **Instances** from the left side menu.

    -   Select the **PublicEC2Server**EC2 instance from the instance list.

    -   From the Description tab, copy the **IPv4 Public IP**.

    -   Now paste this IP into your web browser and click [Enter]

    -   You will see the following page:\

       **Note: This is because the Custom NACL which is attached to your Public subnet restricts both INBOUND and OUTBOUND traffic.**

2.  Private EC2 Instance:

    -   Since the Public NACL restricts all traffic, you won't be able to SSH into the public EC2 Instance to ping the Private Instance.

    -   Next, we are going to solve this.

Task 7: Adding Rules to Custom NACL (MyPublicNACL)
---------------------------------------------------

1.  Navigate to **VPC** under the **Services** menu. Click on **Network ACLs**    under **Security.**

2.  Select **MyPublicNACL** from the list.

3.  In the Inbound rules, click **Edit inbound rules**

4.  Add the following rules:

    -   **HTTP** click on **Add rules,**

        -   Rule# : Enter ***100***

        -   Type: Choose **HTTP (80)**

        -   Source: Enter ***0.0.0.0/0***

        -   Allow / Deny: Select Allow

    -   For **ALL ICMP- IPv4**, click on **Add rules**,

        -   **Rule#** : Enter ***150***

        -   Type: Choose**ALL ICMP - IPv4 **

        -   Source: Enter ***0.0.0.0/0***

        -   Allow / Deny: Select Allow

    -   For **SSH**, click on **Add rules**,

        -   **Rule# : Enter** ***200***

        -   Type: Choose **SSH (22) **

        -   Source: Enter ***0.0.0.0/0***

        -   Allow / Deny: Select Allow\

        -   Click on **Save changes**

5.  In the **Outbound rules** Tab, Click Edit outbound rules

6.  Add the following rules:

    -   **Custom Port** is already available,

        -   Rule# : Enter ***100***

        -   Type: Choose **Custom TCP Rule**

        -   Port Range: Enter ***1024 - 65535***

        -   Source: Enter ***0.0.0.0/0***

        -   Allow / Deny: Select *Allow*

    -   For **ALL ICMP- IPv4**, click on **Add rules**,

        -   Rule\# : Enter ***150***

        -   Type: Choose **ALL ICMP - IPv4 **

        -   Source: Enter ***0.0.0.0/0***

        -   Allow / Deny: Select Allow

    -   For **SSH**, click on **Add rules** ,

        -   Rule# : Enter ***200***

        -   Type: Choose **SSH (22) **

        -   Source: Enter******0.0.0.0/0**

        -   Allow / Deny: Select Allow
           
        -   Click on **Save**

Task 8: Testing Both EC2 instances
-----------------------------------

1.  We will try to ping the Private EC2 from the Public EC2 instance.

    -   SSH into EC2 Instance

    -   Copy the Private IP of **MyPrivateEC2Server** from the Description tab.![]

    -   Ping to the Private Instance using the Private IPv4


-   Press [Ctrl] + C again to cancel the process instead of pausing it.

-   Note: You were able to do these tasks because we added NACL Rules.
