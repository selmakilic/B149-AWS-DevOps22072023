# Hands-on Kubernetes-03 : Kubernetes Networking and Service Discovery

Purpose of this hands-on training is to give students the knowledge of Kubernetes Services.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- Explain the benefits of logically grouping `Pods` with `Services` to access an application.

- Explore the service discovery options available in Kubernetes.

- Learn different types of Services in Kubernetes.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster

- Part 2 - Services, Load Balancing, and Networking in Kubernetes

## Part 1 - Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster

- Launch a Kubernetes Cluster of Ubuntu 20.04 with two nodes (one master, one worker) 

Kubernetes sandbox platforms:
https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/try-now.html (requires subscription, free for 10 days)
https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/


- Check if Kubernetes is running and nodes are ready.

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get no
```

## Part 2 - Services, Load Balancing, and Networking in Kubernetes

### Defining and Deploying Services

- Let's define a setup to observe the behaviour of `services` in Kubernetes and how they work in practice.

- Create a folder and name it service-lessons.

```bash
mkdir service-lessons
cd service-lessons
```

- Create `yaml` file named `web-flask.yaml` and explain fields of it.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1 
kind: Deployment 
metadata:
  name: web-flask-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 3 
  selector:  
    matchLabels:
      app: web-flask # deployment bu etiketi taşıyan podlarla eşleşir
  minReadySeconds: 10 #hazır olduğunu anlamamız için geçen süre
  strategy: # pod ekleme çıkarma güncelleme sırasında izlenecek yol
    type: RollingUpdate # sırayla güncelle ya da recreate ile aynı anda güncelle
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1 
      maxSurge: 1 
  template: # bu kısımdan itibaren pod ve container detayları tanımlanır
    metadata:
      labels: # pod etikeleri burada
        app: web-flask
        env: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-flask-cont
        image: mefekadocker/web-flask:0.2 # docker hub repodan çekilen imajın adı
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000 # container içindeki uygulamanın portu
```

- Create the web-flask Deployment.
  
```bash
kubectl apply -f web-flask.yaml
```

- Show the Pods detailed information and learn their IP addresses:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- We get an output like below.

```text
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP               NODE
web-flask-deploy-8649c67947-2w568   1/1     Running   0          9s    172.16.180.4   kube-worker-1   <none>           <none>
web-flask-deploy-8649c67947-db5vm   1/1     Running   0          9s    172.16.180.6   kube-worker-1   <none>           <none>
web-flask-deploy-8649c67947-hdjd8   1/1     Running   0          9s    172.16.180.5   kube-worker-1   <none>           <none>
```

In the output above, for each Pod the IPs are internal and specific to each instance. If we were to redeploy the application, then each time a new IP will be allocated.

We now check we can ping a Pod inside the cluster.

- Create a `test.yaml` file to create a Pod that pings a Pod inside the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: busybox-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
    command: ['sh','-c','while true;do sleep 3600;done'] # container oluştururken şu komutu çalıştırmasını sağla, böylelikle çalışıp stop etmeyecek, sürekli çalışacak
```

- Create a `busybox` pod and log into the container.

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl apply -f test.yaml
kubectl exec -it busybox-test -- curl <IP-ADDRESS>
/ # ping 172.16.166.180
```

- Show the Pods detailed information and learn their IP addresses again.

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Scale the deployment down to zero.

```bash
kubectl scale deploy web-flask-deploy --replicas=0
```

- List the pods again and note that there is no pod in web-flask-deploy.

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Scale the deployment up to three replicas.

```bash
kubectl scale deploy web-flask-deploy --replicas=3
```

- List the pods again and note that the pods are changed.

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Get the documentation of `Services` and its fields.

```bash
kubectl explain svc
```

- Create a `web-svc.yaml` file with following content and explain fields of it.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service   
metadata:
  name: web-flask-svc
  labels:
    app: web-flask
spec:
  type: ClusterIP  
  ports:
  - port: 3000  # clusterIP servis portu
    targetPort: 8000 # container yayınını yakalamak için hedef port
  selector:
    env: front-end # label env: front-end olan podlar eşlenecek
```
  
```bash
kubectl apply -f web-svc.yaml
```

- List the services.

```bash
kubectl get svc -o wide
```

```text
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE     SELECTOR
kubernetes      ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP                  4h39m   <none>
web-flask-svc   ClusterIP   10.98.173.110   <none>        3000/TCP                 28m     app=web-flask
kube-dns        ClusterIP   10.96.0.10      <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   4h39m   k8s-app=kube-dns
```

- Display information about the `web-flask-svc` Service.

```bash
kubectl describe svc web-flask-svc
```

```text
Name:              web-flask-svc
Namespace:         default
Labels:            app=web-flask
Annotations:       <none>
Selector:          app=web-flask
Type:              ClusterIP
IP Family Policy:  SingleStack
IP Families:       IPv4 
IP:                10.105.60.230
IPs:               10.105.60.230
Port:              <unset>  3000/TCP
TargetPort:        5000/TCP
Endpoints:         172.16.180.5:5000,172.16.180.6:5000
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
```
- Go to the ping pod and ping to the deployment which has service with ClusterIP
```
kubectl exec -it busybox-test -- sh
/ # curl <IP of service web-flask-svc>:3000
/ # ping web-flask-svc 
/ # curl web-flask-svc:3000
```

- To connect web-flask page, we can use service name, in our case it is `web-flask-svc`, instead of cluster ip.

/ # curl <cluster ip of service>:3000   # in our case, cluster ip=10.98.173.110
```bash

/ # curl web-flask-svc:3000
```

- try `nslookup` with pod IPs, service name and service IP

```bash
/# nslookup web-flask-svc
```


- As we see kubernetes services provide DNS resolution.


- Try changing port values in service yaml file then try curl on busybox again.


### NodePort

- Change the service type of web-flask-svc service to NodePort to use the Node IP and a static port to expose the service outside the cluster. So we get the yaml file below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service   
metadata:
  name: web-flask-svc
  labels:
    app: web-flask
spec:
  type: NodePort  
  ports:
  - port: 3000  
    targetPort: 8000
  selector:
    env: front-end 
```

- Configure the web-flask-svc service via apply command.

```bash
kubectl apply -f web-svc.yaml
```

- List the services again. Note that kubernetes exposes the service in a random port within the range 30000-32767 using the Node’s primary IP address.

```bash
kubectl get svc -o wide
```

```
kubectl exec -it busybox-test -- sh
/ # curl <IP of service web-flask-svc>:3000
/ # ping web-flask-svc 
/ # curl web-flask-svc:3000
```

- We can visit `http://<public-node-ip>:<node-port>` and access the application. Pay attention to load balancing. 
Note: Do not forget to open the Port `<node-port>` in the security group of your node instance.

- We can also define NodePort via adding nodePort number to service yaml file. Check the below. 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service   
metadata:
  name: web-flask-svc
  labels:
    app: web-flask
spec:
  type: NodePort 
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30036  # dışardan gelen trafiğin gireceği kapı
    port: 3000    # cluster içinden gelen trafiğin gireceği kapı    
    targetPort: 8000 # yayın yapan container app kapısı
  selector:
    env: front-end
```

- Configure the web-flask-svc service  again via apply command.

```bash
kubectl apply -f web-svc.yaml
```

- List the services and notice that nodeport number is 30036.

```bash
kubectl get svc -o wide
```

- We can visit `http://<public-node-ip>:30036` and access the application. 


### Endpoints

As Pods come-and-go (scaling up and down, failures, rolling updates etc.), the Service dynamically updates its list of Pods. It does this through a combination of the label selector and a construct called an Endpoint object.

Each Service that is created automatically gets an associated Endpoint object. This Endpoint object is a dynamic list of all of the Pods that match the Service’s label selector.

Kubernetes is constantly evaluating the Service’s label selector against the current list of Pods in the cluster. Any new Pods that match the selector get added to the Endpoint object, and any Pods that disappear get removed. This ensures the Service is kept up-to-date as Pods come and go.

- Get the documentation of `Endpoints` and its fields.

```bash
kubectl explain ep
```

- List the Endpoints.

```bash
kubectl get ep -o wide
```

- Scale the deployment up to ten replicas and list the `Endpoints`.

```bash
kubectl scale deploy web-flask-deploy --replicas=10
```

- List the `Endpoints` and explain that the Service has an associated `Endpoint` object with an always-up-to-date list of Pods matching the label selector.

```bash
kubectl get ep -o wide 
```

> Open a browser on any node and explain the `loadbalancing` via browser. (Pay attention to the host ip and node name and note that `host ips` and `endpoints` are same)
>
> http://[public-node-ip]:[node-port]

### Labels and loose coupling

- Pods and Services are loosely coupled via labels and label selectors. For a Service to match a set of Pods, and therefore provide stable networking and load-balance, it only needs to match some of the Pods labels. However, for a Pod to match a Service, the Pod must match all of the values in the Service’s label selector.

- Add `version: v1` to `web-svc.yaml --> spec.selector`. So that you end up with:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-flask-svc
  labels:
    app: web-flask
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 3000
    nodePort: 30036
    targetPort: 8000
  selector:
    env: front-end
    version: v1
```

- Use kubectl apply to push your configuration changes to the cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f web-svc.yaml
```

- Reload the page, and see that we can not see the page because of that the Service is selecting on two labels, but the Pods only have one of them. The logic behind this is a Boolean `AND` operation.

- Add `version: v1` to `web-flask.yaml --> spec.template.metadata.labels`. So that you end up with:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-flask-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-flask
  minReadySeconds: 10
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-flask
        env: front-end
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-flask-pod
        image: mefekadocker/web-flask:0.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
```

- Use kubectl apply to push your configuration changes to the cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f web-flask.yaml
```

- Reload the page again, and now we can see the page because the `Service` is selecting on two labels and the Pods have all of them.

- Add `test: coupling` to `web-flask.yaml --> spec.template.metadata.labels`. So that you end up with:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-flask-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-flask
  minReadySeconds: 10
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-flask
        env: front-end
        version: v1
        test: coupling
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-flask-pod
        image: mefekadocker/web-flask:0.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
```

- Push your configuration changes to the cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f web-flask.yaml
```

- Reload the page again, and we see the page although the `Pods` have additional labels that the `Service` is selecting on.

### To connect a service from different namespace

- Kubernetes has an add-on for DNS, which creates a DNS record for each Service and its format is:

`web-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`

- Services within the same Namespace find other Services just by their names. 

- Let's understand this issue with an example.

- First of all remove whole deployment and service in the default namespace

```bash
kubectl delete -f .
```

- Create a namespace and name it `demo`.

```bash
kubectl create namespace demo
```

- Create a deployment inside the `demo` namespace with `web-flask.yaml` file.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-flask-deploy
  namespace: demo
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-flask
  minReadySeconds: 10
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-flask
        env: front-end
        version: v1
        test: coupling
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-flask-pod
        image: mefekadocker/web-flask:0.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
```
- Create a service inside the `web-svc.yaml` namespace.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-flask-svc
  namespace: demo
  labels:
    app: web-flask
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 3000
    targetPort: 8000
    nodePort: 30036 
  selector:
    env: front-end
```
- create deployment and service
```bash
kubectl apply -f .
```

- show all namespaces
```bash
kubectl get ns
```

- Lets see the all objects within demo namespace and default namespace
```bash
kubectl get deploy -n demo
kubectl get pod -n demo
kubectl get svc -n demo
kubectl get pod
kubectl get svc
```

- log into the container and curl the `web-flask-svc` inside `demo` namespace.

```bash
kubectl exec -it busybox-test -- sh
/ # curl web-flask-svc.demo:3000

or we can use `FQDN`.

/ #  curl web-flask-svc.demo.svc.cluster.local:3000
```

- Delete all objects.

```bash
kubectl delete -f .
kubectl delete ns demo
```
