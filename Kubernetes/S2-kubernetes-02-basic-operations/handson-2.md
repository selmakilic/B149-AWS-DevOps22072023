# Kubernetes Hands-on Day-2 : Kubernetes Basics


## Part 1 - Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster


https://www.killercoda.com/courses/kubernetes/playground

- Check if Kubernetes is running and nodes are ready.

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get node
```

## Part 2 - Basic Operations in Kubernetes

- Show the names and short names of the supported API resources as shown in the example:
alias k=kubectl

|NAME|SHORTNAMES|
|----|----------|
|deployments|deploy
|events     |ev
|endpoints  |ep
|nodes      |no
|pods       |po
|services   |svc

```bash
kubectl api-resources
```

- To view kubectl commands:

```
kubectl help
```

- Get the documentation of `Nodes` and its fields.

```bash
kubectl explain nodes
```

- View the nodes in the cluster using.

```bash
kubectl get nodes 
```

### pods

- Get the documentation of `Pods` and its fields.

```bash
kubectl explain pods
```

- create a pod using imperative way

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```


- List the pods.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```


- Create yaml file named `mypod.yaml` and explain fields of it.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mynginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

- Create a pod with `kubectl create` command.

```bash
kubectl create -f mypod.yaml
```

- Use apply command this time and see the output message, apply command applies changes if any.

```bash
kubectl apply -f mypod.yaml
```

- List the pods.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

- List pods in `ps output format` with more information (such as node name).
  
```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Show details of pod.

```bash
kubectl describe pods/nginx-pod
```

- Show details of pod in `yaml format`.
  
```bash
kubectl get pods/nginx-pod -o yaml
```

- Delete the pod.

```bash
kubectl delete -f mypod.yaml
# or
kubectl delete pod nginx-pod

kubectl delete -f .
```

### ReplicaSets

- Get the documentation of `replicasets` and its fields.

```bash
kubectl explain replicaset
```

- Create yaml file named `myreplicaset.yaml` and explain fields of it.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
  labels:
    environment: dev
spec:
  # modify replicas according to your case
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mynginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

- Create the replicaset with `kubectl apply` command.

```bash
kubectl apply -f myreplicaset.yaml
```

- List the replicasets.

```bash
kubectl get replicaset
```

- List pods with more information.
  
```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Show details of replicasets.

```bash
 kubectl get rs
kubectl describe replicaset <replicaset-name>
```
- Change label of a pod and see behaviour
```bash
kubectl get replicaset
```


- Delete replicasets

```bash
kubectl delete -f myreplicaset.yaml
```

#### Pod Selector

The .spec.selector field is a label selector. 

The .spec.selector field and .spec.template.metadata field must be same. There are additional issues related this subject like loose coupling, but we discuss this on service object.  

### Deployments

- Get the documentation of `Deployments` and its fields.

```bash
kubectl explain deployments
```

- Create yaml file named `mydeployment.yaml` and explain fields of it.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    environment: dev
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

- Create the deployment with `kubectl apply` command.
  
```bash
kubectl apply -f mydeployment.yaml
```

- List the deployments.

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

- List pods with more information.
  
```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Show details of deployments.

```bash
kubectl describe deploy/nginx-deployment
```

- Print the logs for a container in a pod.

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

- If there is a multi-container pod, we can print logs of one container.

- Execute a command in a container.

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- date
```

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

- Open a bash shell in a container.

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- bash
```

- List the ReplicaSets.

```bash
kubectl get rs
```

- Show details of ReplicaSets.

```bash
kubectl describe rs <rs-name>
```

- Scale the deployment/replicaset up to five replicas.

```bash
kubectl scale deploy nginx-deployment --replicas=5
```

- Delete a pod and show new pod is immediately created.

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
kubectl get pods
```

- But each time do we have to apply these commands for scaling? No because there will be our yml file and we can change it when we need to scale.

- Delete deployments

```bash
kubectl delete -f mydeployment.yaml
```
alias k=kubectl

## Part 3 - Deployment Rolling Update and Rollback in Kubernetes

- Create a new folder name it deployment-lesson.

```bash
mkdir deployment-lesson
cd deployment-lesson
```

- Create a `devops-deploy.yaml` and input text below. Pay attention to the image version.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: devops-deploy
  labels:
    app: container-info
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/change-cause: devops-deploy is set as container-info=gluobe/container-info:green
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: container-info
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: container-info
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: container-info
        image: gluobe/container-info:green
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

- Create the deployment with `kubectl apply` command.

```bash
kubectl apply -f devops-deploy.yaml
```

- List the `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet` and `Pods` of `devops-deploy` deployment using a label and note the name of ReplicaSet.

```bash
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -l app=container-info
```

- Describe deployment and note the image of the deployment. In our case, it is gluobe/container-info:green

```bash
kubectl describe deploy devops-deploy
```

- View previous rollout revisions.

```bash
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy
```

- Display details with revision number, in our case, is 1. And note name of image.

```bash
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy --revision=1
```

- Upgrade image.
set img dg≈ü
```bash
kubectl set image deploy devops-deploy container-info=gluobe/container-info:blue --record=true 
```

- Show the rollout history.

```bash
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy
```

- Display details about the revisions.

```bash
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy --revision=1
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy --revision=2
```

- List the `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet` and `Pods` of `devops-deploy` deployment using a label and explain ReplicaSets.

```bash
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -l app=container-info
```

- Upgrade image with kubectl edit commands.

```bash
kubectl edit deploy/devops-deploy
```

- We will see an output like below.

```yaml
# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
# reopened with the relevant failures.
#
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: "2"
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
    ...
```

- Change the `metadata.annotations.kubernetes.io/change-cause` and `spec.template.spec.containers.image` fields as below.

```yaml
...
...
    kubernetes.io/change-cause: kubectl set image deploy devops-deploy container-info=gluobe/container-info:variable
...
...
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gluobe/container-info:variable 
...
...
```

- Show the rollout history.

```bash
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy
```

- Display details about the revisions.

```bash
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy --revision=1
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy --revision=2
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy --revision=3
```

- Apply `kubectl get rs` and show how many replica set exist and explain why?

- List the `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet` and `Pods` of `devops-deploy` deployment using a label and explain ReplicaSets.

```bash
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -l app=container-info
```

- Rollback to `revision 1`.

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deploy devops-deploy --to-revision=1
```

- Show the rollout history and show that we have revision 2, 3 and 4. Explain that original revision, which is `revision 1`, becomes `revision 4`.

```bash
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy --revision=2
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy --revision=3
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy --revision=4
```

- Try to pull up the `revision 1`, that is no longer available.

```bash
kubectl rollout history deploy devops-deploy --revision=1
```

- List the `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet` and `Pods` of `mynginx` deployment using a label, and explain that the original ReplicaSet has been scaled up back to three and second ReplicaSet has been scaled down to zero.

```bash
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -l app=container-info
```

- Delete the deployment.

```bash
kubectl delete deploy -l app=container-info
kubectl delete -f .
```

## Part 4 - Namespaces in Kubernetes

- List the current namespaces in a cluster using and explain them. *Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called `namespaces`.*

```bash
kubectl get namespace
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   118m
kube-node-lease   Active   118m
kube-public       Active   118m
kube-system       Active   118m

kubectl get namespace default 
```

>### default
>The default namespace for objects with no other namespace

>### kube-system
>The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system

>### kube-public
>This namespace is created automatically and is readable by all users (including those not authenticated). This >namespace is mostly reserved for cluster usage, in case that some resources should be visible and readable >publicly throughout the whole cluster. The public aspect of this namespace is only a convention, not a >requirement.

>### kube-node-lease
>This namespace for the lease objects associated with each node which improves the performance of the node  heartbeats as the cluster scales.

- Create a new YAML file called `my-namespace.yaml` with the following content.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: devops-namespace
```

- Create a namespace using the `my-namespace.yaml` file.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./my-namespace.yaml
```

- Alternatively, you can create namespace using below command:

```bash
kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>
```

- Create pods in each namespace.

```bash
kubectl create deployment default-ns --image=nginx
```

- List the deployments in `default` namespace.

```bash
kubectl get deployment
```

- List all deployments.

```bash
kubectl get deployment -o wide --all-namespaces
```

- Delete the namespace.

```bash
kubectl delete namespaces devops-namespace
```
